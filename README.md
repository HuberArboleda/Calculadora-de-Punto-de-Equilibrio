This project is a **break-even calculator** that allows users to calculate the break-even point of a product based on its selling price, production cost, and fixed costs.

## Description

The **break-even calculator** is a tool that helps business owners or entrepreneurs determine how many units they need to sell in order to cover their fixed costs. Based on three input values:

1. **Selling price per unit**: The price at which the product is sold.
2. **Production cost per unit**: The cost to produce one unit of the product.
3. **Fixed cost**: The fixed costs that don't depend on the quantity produced, such as rent, salaries, etc.

The calculator shows the number of units required to break even, as well as the corresponding total revenue.

Additionally, it generates a graph visualizing both the revenue and total costs as the number of units sold increases.

## Features

- Automatic calculation of the break-even point.
- Interactive graph displaying both revenue and total costs.
- User-friendly and responsive interface.
- Input validation to ensure correct values.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Visual styling using TailwindCSS.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for calculations and handling interactivity.
- **Chart.js**: Library for generating interactive graphs.

## Usage

1. Enter the values for **selling price per unit**, **production cost per unit**, and **fixed cost** into the respective fields.
2. Click the **Calculate** button.
3. The result will show the number of units required to break even and the total revenue.
4. A graph will be generated automatically, showing how revenue and total costs change as the number of units increases.
